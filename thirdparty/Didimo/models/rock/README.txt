Instructions for the use of your didimo:
----------------------------------------

The provided FBX file includes both the mesh geometry of the didimo, and an attached facial skeleton for animation and posing.

To use your didimo inside a project or application, import the FBX file using an appropriate FBX importer. Most 3D applications and game frameworks will provide this functionality as part of their standard model import procedure.

Sometimes the textures may have to be assigned manually, according to the application.

Enjoy your didimo!
